# Our Project
A grocery shopping tool for blind and visually impaired people.

## Whoa, that's cool! Tell me more.
Our project consists of a grocery assistant system for the visually impaired. We hope to build some sort of app that provides haptic/auditory feedback (e.g. through vibration) to users when they are in close proximity to sensors placed in various aisles around a grocery store. Based on one’s distance to said sensors, the assistant system will notify the person of which aisle they are closest to. Our hopes are that this system will facilitate mobility and improve the shopping experience for visually impaired people.

## Who are you, anyway?
We are a group of undergrads and grad students from a variety of different backgrounds! Our group consists of Carolyn J. Applebaum, Sofía García Martinez, Uday Saharia, and Sydney Zink.
