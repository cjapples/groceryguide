# Our Project
A grocery shopping tool for blind and visually impaired people.

## Whoa, that's cool! Tell me more.
Our project consists of a grocery assistant system for the visually impaired. This technology would include at least two modes (subject to the serviced group's interests), including one where a user loads or inputs a grocery list tagged by product category and they would get haptic feedback in the store whenever in proximity to any of the yet-alerted items (i.e. in physical proximity to the product category in the store), and one more exploratory mode without any pre-populated shopping list where such sensors in the store would give a verbal notification to the user of which food category they are passing whenever they come into proximity of one such sensor. Our hopes are that this system will facilitate mobility and improve the shopping experience for visually impaired people.

## Who are you, anyway?
We are a group of undergrads and grad students from a variety of different backgrounds! Our group consists of Carolyn J. Applebaum, Sofía García Martinez, and Uday Saharia.
